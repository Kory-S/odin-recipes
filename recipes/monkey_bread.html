                Instructions:
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare pan</strong></li>
                Heavily grease Bundt or fluted tube pan with butter (12-cup capacity). Preheat oven to 350°F.
                <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong></li>
                Separate biscuits and cut each one into four equal bite-sized pieces. Combine granulated sugar and cinnamon in a bowl or plastic bag. Drop roll each piece of dough in the sugar-cinnamon mixture and shake around to coat. Gently arrange the cinnamon-sugar biscuit pieces into the prepared pan.
                <li><strong>Heat syrup</strong></li>
                In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar and butter. Add ½ cup of the remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture (discard remaining or use for another recipe). Gently heat to melt butter and bring mixture just to a boil and then immediately remove from heat. Stir until sugars have fully dissolved. Do not overcook the syrup; you simply want to help the sugar dissolve. Carefully drizzle the warm mixture over the rolled dough balls in the pan.

                Arrange pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Time may vary
                <li><strong>Invert</strong></li>
                Allow pan to rest for about 5 minutes, then cover with a large plate and invert. To eat, pull the desired amount off with your fingers and enjoy
